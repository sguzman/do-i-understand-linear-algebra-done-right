** Do I Understand [Linear Algebra Done Right?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw)
This is a progress checklist as I make my way through the "Linear Algebra Done
Right" playlist on youtube.

For each video I will make a checkbox and check it if I understand the material
presented in the video proper.

*** Why?
I am hoping making my attempt to understand the nuances of linear algebra more
public will incentivize me top work my way comprehensively through the playlist.
